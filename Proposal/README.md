## Problem to resolve: 
Technology has made our lives much easier and more enjoyable. However, there are negative consequences to this. We may become addicted to technology to the point where it can affect many aspects of our lives by disrupting our focus, encourage procrastination, and can potentially cause health issues. With this program users can manage their screen time, reduce digital distractions, and in return boost their productivity and promote healthy use of technology.

## Assumptions / operating environments / intended usage:
The operating environment of this program would be on a website. The user would be using this app to allow them to enhance their focus. The user can personalize the program to accommodate their needs. 

## High-level description: 
The approach is to make this program as personalizable as possible. For example, a user can set how long they would like to use this program for whether it be a couple of hours to the whole day. The user can also set limits to what they want to block out such as websites. They can also set personal goals for themselves. We also want to gamify the experience so that it does not feel boring and is easier to use. The user can see their progress and earn achievements by completing their goals. This in turn will encourage frequent use of the program which will help the user stay on track. 

## Functionality:
A user may use this program to track and manage their screen time throughout the day by logging their activity. They can also set personalized goals, reminders, and notifications that will help them make progress in their activities. The user can also block websites or applications that they deem distracting for a certain amount of time or until a task is finished. Since this program also wants to discourage additional unnecessary technology usage, the activity logging feature will also display acitivites that are non-digital to encourage better health habits. The user will also be able to see their data through graphs to track how much progress they have made.
