## Problem to resolve: 
Technology has made our lives much easier and more enjoyable. However, there are negative consequences to this. We may become addicted to technology to the point where it can affect many aspects of our lives by disrupting our focus, encourage procrastination, and can potentially cause health issues. With this program users can manage their screen time, reduce digital distractions, and in return boost their productivity and promote healthy use of technology.

## Assumptions / operating environments / intended usage:
The operating environment of this program would be on a website. The user would be using this app to allow them to enhance their focus. The user can personalize the program to accommodate their needs. 

## High-level description: 
The approach is to make this program personalizable. The user can set reminders to encourage them to keep working. They can also set personal goals for themselves. We also want to gamify the experience so that it does not feel boring and is easier to use. This will be done using a reward system that allows users to earn achievements. This in turn will encourage frequent use of the program which will help the user stay on track. 

## Functionality:
The user can set personalized goals, reminders, and notifications that will help them make progress in their activities. The reminders can be set to remind users to not use websites that might distract them and reduce their productivity. Since this program also wants to discourage additional unnecessary technology usage, the  program will display acitivites that are non-digital to encourage better health habits, such as a reminder to get away from the computer every once in a while. The user will also be able to view their progress and activity through a dashboard to track how much progress they have made.
